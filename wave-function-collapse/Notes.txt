TO-DO:
- Use sprites instead of solid rectangles
- Following is redundant if I implement image pixel-based matching for the edges
- This should probably be some option instead of forced
-- Actually use the triple-check for asymmetric tiles (if I actually get asymmetric tiles :) )
- Implement rotating tiles to ease manual tile-mapping
